## Objective:
The objectives of this project are not to create an operating system that can rival the modern ones. The goal is to simply learn the software engineering that goes on behind the scenes when creating an operating system. I have simply followed [this youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M) so all the credit goes to the awesome guy who made all the videos typing with one hand and holding the microphone in the other... all the way! #Respect SIR! I don't know if I'll ever complete all the videos but lets give this a go!
