## Objective:
The objective of this project is not to create an operating system that can rival the modern ones. The goal is to simply learn the software engineering that goes on behind the scenes when creating an operating system. I have simply followed [this youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M) so all the credit goes to the awesome guy who made all the videos typing with one hand and holding the microphone in the other... all the way! #Respect SIR! I don't know if I'll ever complete all the videos but lets give this a go!

### How to read this code????
  Well, the most major problem when reading a new code base is that we don't know where to start. But I think I have you covered in this one. I have designed this repository in a way that you can understand what the code is doing. Simply goto the commits of this repository and read the commits from the first one to the last one. With each commit I have added details of what I've done in the commit, under the docs/ folder.

  NOTE: I'll now be following the pull request way of doing things. For each lecture that I see, I'll have a pull request, and I'll add comments on the pull request to highlight what I've done. I'll only add details to the docs/ folder if they are verbose.

### Progress:
  I'm doing this gradually, and as I get time I advance further down in the series, up until this point the os boots up, sets up basic memory, and prints to the screen whenever it receives an interrupt from the interrupt controller. And we have recently implemented keyboard driver, so we now have keystrokes.. :D
