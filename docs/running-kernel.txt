RUNNING KERNEL USING GRUB:
=========================
	The kernel that we have designed does not bootload itself, instead it uses grub's multiboot protocol and can be loaded by grub therefore.
So, we will be using grub to load our kernel, the following steps might be enough to get the task done:
1) First run the install target of the make file by running: 'make install'
2) Then insert the following snippet in /boot/grub/grub.cfg:
	### BEGIN MYKERNEL ###
	menuentry 'My Operating System' {
		multiboot /boot/mykernel.bin
		boot
	}
	### END MYKERNEL ###
As can be read this snippet creates a menu entry and tells grub that upon its selection the file /boot/mykernel.bin should be loaded using the
multiboot method.
3) Now, simply reboot and upon grub screen select the option 'My Operating System' and it should run your kernel.
